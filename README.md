## ðŸ”¬ Data

We present the **Fiction4 corpus** of literary texts, spanning 109 individual texts across 4 genres and two languages (English and Danish) in the 19th and 20th century.
The corpus consists of 3 main authors, Sylvia Plath for poetry, Ernest Hemingway for prose and H.C. Andersen for fairytales. Hymns represent a heterogenous colleciton from Danish official church hymnbooks from 1798-1873.
The corpus was annotated for valence on a sentence basis by at least 2 annotators/sentence.
